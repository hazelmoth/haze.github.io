	<h2>THE TEAM</h2>
	<p>We are a studio based in Washington state. Our goal is to create games, and we strive to keep our complete lack of experience from interfering with that goal.</p>
	<p>We develop a wide variety of games, and are continually exploring a range of game ideas and prototypes in our quest to deliver products that are truly revolutionary (which, admittedly, has been largely unsuccessful thus far).</p>
